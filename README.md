## 6-DOF Simulation
During my time as CTO of Ravyn Technology, I developed this 6-DOF simulation software using Simulink. An image of the Simulink layout is in 6-DOF Simulation/Images, as well as sample outputs for an air-to-air missile, launched with an elevation of 45 degrees. The 6-DOF simulation code is in the file flat_earth_6dof.slx, and can be run for the air-to-air missile if tiw.mat is loaded into your MATLAB workspace. Closed loop controls are also included in the Simulink model, and control coefficients are in the .mat file.

## Thesis
As my undergraduate thesis, I designed and built a tri-copter VTOL delivery drone for 25lb. payloads and 600-mile range with Noah McGuinness and Noah Schocet. I performed a complete aircraft sizing, CFD, longitudinal stability analysis, and designed a VTOL flight controller. Our thesis won the John Marshall II 2nd place thesis prize within the Princeton MAE department. Thus far, the project has culminated in construction of multiple prototypes that were flown as a proof of concept for the aircraft configuration. 

## Operation Space
Operation Space was an intercollegiate effort to send a two-stage, 18 foot, hypersonic, sounding rocket past the Karman Line. The engineering work was done by a small team of
engineers at Princeton University. I designed the interstage adapter and the nozzle expander/interstage interface for the second stage. I performed full assembly FEA on the two
stage vehicle. I was initimately familiar every single one of the 200+ components on the vehicle and oversaw construction of two, two-stage vehicles at Spaceport America. Helped conduct range safety protocols and ensured two successful launches.

## packGenerator 
packGenerator.com was an idea I had in the summer of 2020. As an avid baseball card collector, I wanted to create an application where users could open randomly generated packs of baseball cards and build online collections. I first made a python web scraper using BeautifulSoup to scrape images and names of over half a million baseball cards. I created the web app with ReactJS and the backend was implemented on a Linux VPS with NGINX running a Python Flask backend script. I made an account and registration system as well as a personal baseball card collection system so users can keep the cards they pull out of packs. I store this data on MongoDB.

## Erebus
Erebus was a 20 person team at Princeton University which designed a Lunar Lander to drill and analyze regolith for water on the south pole of the lunar surface and an accompanying Lunar communications orbiter. I was an elected team lead on this project, and was responsible for the science payload on the lander and propulsion systems on the orbiter. Through this project I learned many valuable lessons about engineering design and requirements workflow in a larger team. Some challenges I had to deal with were extreme temperature constraints in the shaded Shackleton crater and volatile sublimation. As for the orbiter, I worked with the GNC team to provide an adequate total impulse over the proposed mission with a hydrazine thruster.

## ACO
This paper is the result of research into how Ant Colony Optimization algirthms are used in the real-world.

## AutoCookie
This project was to design an algorithm that takes a clipart image as an input and outputs an "outline" image that can be used to create a 3D printable cookie cutter. The .exe file takes candidate.jpg, and transforms it into finished_prod.jpg, which can then be used to 3D print a cookie cutter.

## Coursework
These are examples of my coursework at Princeton University. Included here currently is General Relativity.
