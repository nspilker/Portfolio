## packGenerator 
packGenerator.com was an idea I had in the summer of 2020. As an avid baseball card collector, I wanted to create an application where users could open randomly generated packs of baseball cards and build online collections. I first made a python web scraper using BeautifulSoup to scrape images and names of over half a million baseball cards. I created the web app with ReactJS and the backend was implemented on a Linux VPS with NGINX running a Python Flask backend script. I made an account and registration system as well as a personal baseball card collection system so users can keep the cards they pull out of packs. I store this data on MongoDB.

## Erebus
Erebus was a 20 person team at Princeton University which designed a Lunar Lander to drill and analyze regolith for water on the south pole of the lunar surface and an accompanying Lunar communications orbiter. I was an elected team lead on this project, and was responsible for the science payload on the lander and propulsion systems on the orbiter. Through this project I learned many valuable lessons about engineering design and requirements workflow in a larger team. Some challenges I had to deal with were extreme temperature constraints in the shaded Shackleton crater and volatile sublimation. As for the orbiter, I worked with the GNC team to provide an adequate total impulse over the proposed mission with a hydrazine thruster.
